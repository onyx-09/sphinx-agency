"I miss Avaline..."
"I miss her too much"
"My heart was only half when she complited it..."
"Before I knew it, I started having a panic attack when remembering Avaline"
"she was the only girl in my life who treated me like a human. . "
"Without her, who would be the one to comfort me when I'm at my lowest..? She was like a mother to me,"
"i couldn't do anything to make her more happy?"
"She was the one who was making me happy and i really couldn't do anything for her..? "
"She always was like a guardian to me. I look at the items that would remind me of her, it made it slightly better or so.."
"which was kind of sad realizing only Avaline was the girl who'd come to help.. "
"everyone else wouldâ€™ve just ignored me or make fun of me if they saw me like  this..."
"..4:37 AM, I slept crying. I go change and go on a walk,"
"the air seems cold today. Either that or I'm just imagining it was. I sit at the park bench,"
"thinking about my memories with Avaline. "

y "Look at the clouds! aren't they pretty?"
"Yume asks while looking at the clouds."
pov "...yeah."
"I look at the clouds aswell,"

pov "HUH?"
"sound out of instinct."
"She was quite shocked by the sudden sound but chuckled,"
y "pretty random to ask you, that's understandable." 
y "I saw you during the audition with a girl but then found out what happened to her."
y  "It was really sad to hear though, kage was the one to inform me about it." 
"She added on, she looked down while in such a gloomy face."
y "you must've been really great friends with her."
"it was true, we were great friends."
"our friendship simply felt so short. "
pov "we were."
"I replied, we both shared a quite moment again. A few minutes later.. I've been thinking about her offer, I look at her."
pov "hey.. about your question about joining the agency.." 
"I say, hesitating. she turned to look at me with a curious look."
pov "I'll accept."
"I say, she was quite enlightened."
y "REALLY?!"
pov "i figured.. Avy would've been happy for me if I joined on her behalf,"
pov "she gets proud of me when I follow her footsteps."
"I tell her,"
y  "like a mother!" 
"she comments, she's not wrong though. Avaline was there for me almost my whole life if I can recall."
pov "The clouds are pretty."
"I said"
"I'm sure Avy is so happy jumping on clouds for the first time."
